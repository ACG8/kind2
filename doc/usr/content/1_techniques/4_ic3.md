## IC3

[IC3/PDR](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-18275-4_7) is a recent technique by Aaron Bradley. IC3 alone can falsify and prove properties. To enable nothing but IC3, run

```
kind2 --enable IC3 <file>
```

The challenge when lifting IC3 to infinite state systems is the pre-image computation. If the input problem is in linear integer arithmetic, Kind 2 performs a fast approximate quantifier elimination. Otherwise, the quantifier elimination is delegated to an SMT solver, which is at this time only possible with Z3.



### Options


`--pdr_qe {cooper|Z3}` -- select the quantifier elimination strategy: `cooper` (default) for the built-in approximate method, `Z3` to delegate to the SMT solver. If the problem is not in linear integer arithmetic, `cooper` falls back to `Z3`.

`--pdr_check_inductive` -- Check if a blocking clause is inductive and communicate it as an invariant to concurrent verification engines. 

`--pdr_block_in_future` -- Block each clause not only in the frame it was discovered, but also in all higher frames.

`--pdr_fwd_prop_non_gen` -- Attempt forward propagation of clauses before inductive generalization.

`--pdr_fwd_prop_ind_gen` -- Inductively generalize clauses after forward propagation.

`--pdr_fwd_prop_subsume` -- Check syntactic subsumption of forward propagated clauses
