# Lustre

Lustre is a functional, synchronous dataflow language. Kind2 supports most of the Lustre V4 syntax and some elements of Lustre V6. See the file [`./examples/syntax-test.lus`](https://github.com/kind2-mc/kind2/blob/develop/examples/syntax-test.lus) for examples of all supported language constructs.
